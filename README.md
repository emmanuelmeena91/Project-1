# Project Name
To-Do-List.

This is a simple to-do list app that allows users to add, edit, and delete tasks. Users can enter their name to personalize the app, and the app stores the tasks in the browser's local storage so that they persist across sessions.
# Usage
To use the app, enter your name in the input field and click the "Add name" button. Once you've added your name, the app will display a personalized welcome message and an input field to add tasks. To add a task, simply enter the task in the input field and click the "Add task" button. To delete a task, click the "Delete" button next to the task. To edit your name, click the "Edit name" button.

The app stores the tasks in the browser's local storage, so they will persist across sessions. If you close the app and open it again, your tasks will still be there.
